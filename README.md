Dockerfile was a ideal method for docker image. Nextflow was an easy way for bioinformatic analysis based on docker images. Here bulid a Dockefile with docker and nextflow.

It's based on Alpine Linux 3.10 image, which is a very small Linux distribution, which show more safety as its small size. The Dockerfile will update often depend on the docker and nextflow version. For its most utility use, nf-core projects will be most forked.
Summary info:
* OS: Alpine Linux 3.10
* docker: 18.09.7
* nextflow: 19.04.1.5072
